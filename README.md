##Dragon Ball Super Heroes

**A long time ago, there existed an evil organization known as the Red Ribbon Army led by Commander Red. Though they were seemingly defeated by the young child Goku, their head scientist, Dr. Gero, escaped and many years later was responsible for the creation of the Androids and Cell. Magenta, the son of Commander Red, has spent his time hoping to bring about the return of the Red Ribbon Army, using Red Pharmaceuticals as a front. He and his second-in-command Carmine learn of Dr. Hedo, the grandson of Dr. Gero.**
